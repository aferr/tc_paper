\begin{abstract}
    This paper presents timing compartments, a hardware architecture primitive 
    that completely eliminates microarchitectural timing channels between 
    groups software entities (e.g. processes or virtual machines) specified by 
    the system owner. When coupled with conventional software system isolation 
    such as access controls, timing compartments provide total software 
    isolation. This grants distrusting entities the security of executing on 
    separate hardware with some of the performance benefits of sharing 
    hardware. By separating timing channel control from explicit channel 
    control, timing compartments afford the flexibility to pay for timing 
    channel protection only when necessary. To realize timing compartments, we 
    develop and experimentally evaluate a microarchitecture that eliminates 
    timing side channels and timing covert channels for every vulnerable 
    hardware component. In doing so, we expose the challenges in integrating 
    protection mechanisms for interdependent components and reveal two novel 
    microarchitecture timing channels.
