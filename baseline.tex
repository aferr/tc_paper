\section{Baseline Architecture}

            \label{fig:baseline}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}

    Figure \ref{fig:baseline} shows the baseline architecture which is later 
    extended to include timing channel protection. The architecture has 
    multiple cores, each with a branch predictor, one or more private caches, a 
    TLB, and the core logic. Each processor is connected to a shared cache 
    through an on-chip network. The multicore processor is connected to the 
    main memory and a DMA module through the system bus. 

    The hardware is concurrently shared by multiple security domains. A 
    security domain consists of one or more software modules (such as processes 
    or threads in a single OS system or virtual machines in a virtualization 
    based system). Software modules within the same security domain trust each 
    other, but information flows between security domains must be controlled 
    according to a policy that meets the security requirements of the system.
    Often, this policy entails of a lattice of security levels such as 
    $\mathtt{normal} \sqsubseteq \mathtt{secure}$, where the information 
    available to a security domain includes any information available to 
    security domains with an equal security level and with levels that preceed 
    it in the lattice order. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:baseline}, it is 
    possible for a security domain to have multiple virtual machines which may 
    be allocated to different cores. It is also possible for security domains 
    to be time multiplexd on the same core (e.g.  by context switching VMs), 
    but it is not possible for security domains to execute concurrently on the 
    same core (e.g. through SMT).

\section{Usage Scenarios and Threat Models}

    This section describes some example applications for the architecture and 
    the thread model for each usage scenario.

    \subsection{DRM Video Playback}
    Mobile devices often support applications that playback videos with
    DRM restrictions. For example, a user may only be able to play a video if 
    he or she has a valid subscription to the service. In this case, the 
    attacker is the owner of the mobile device who would either like to access 
    content without paying for a subscription. The adversary is capable of any 
    software attack which includes the exploitation of timing channels.

    \subsubsection{DRM Protection Security Mechanisms}
    % AMD TrustZone \cite{trustzone} exemplifies a state of the practice 
    % solution that can enforce these security properties, however, TrustZone 
    % does not offer protection against timing channel attacks. Since the 
    % adversary can carry out any software attack and timing channels can be 
    % exploited with software attacks, timing channel protection is necessary 
    % to meet the security requirements.

            \caption{The security domains of TrustZone-like processor.}
            \label{fig:tz_domains}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}
   
    ARM TrustZone \cite{trustzone} exemplifies a state of the practice solution 
    that can enforce security properties that support this DRM video playback 
    usage model.
    TrustZone separates the software modules into two security domains as shown 
    in Figure \ref{fig:tz_domains} . The first security domain is called the 
    normal world and it has a virtual processor that contains the operating 
    system and all user-space applications. The other security domain, the 
    secure world, contains a virtual processor that contains only a small 
    execution environment and a set of very simple libraries for handling 
    protected operations. This virtual processor does not contain a complete 
    operating system and the libraries do not require any operating system 
    support (e.g. they may not have system calls). The secure world also 
    contains software for a simple monitor mode that handles context switching 
    between the two domains if they are time multiplexed on the same core. The 
    security levels of these domains form a lattice such that the level of the 
    normal world precedes the level of the secure world (i.e. information 
    available to the normal world is available to the secure world). All of the 
    secure world code is small to reduce the chance of vulnerabilities. The 
    secure world must only allow the normal world to play the video if the 
    subscription is valid. 


    \begin{figure}
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[width=3in]{figs/tz_tags.pdf}
            \caption{DRM Protection Mechnamisms. The baseline architecture is 
            extended with tags that control explicit information flows between 
        the secure and normal worlds.}
            \label{fig:tz_uarch}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}

    TrustZone extends the baseline cores of Figure \ref{fig:baseline} to
    those shown in Figure \ref{fig:tz_uarch}. The core logic contains a tag to 
    store which world is currently executing. Each cache entry has a tag to 
    indicate if the entry can be accessed by the normal world or not. To make 
    an access to the memory hierarchy, the core sends the virtual address and 
    the current world to the TLB. The TLB gets the physical address as normal 
    (performing a page table walk if needed). The physical address and current 
    security domain are sent to the cache. If the cache contains the physical 
    address and the tag of the entry indicates that the current world has 
    sufficient rights to accesss the entry, the access proceeds normally.  
    Otherwise, if it is a cache miss, the cache sends the physical address and 
    the current world to the system bus to access the main memory. If the tag 
    of the address in main memory indicates that the current world has 
    sufficient rights, the cache block is brought into the cache as normal and 
    the tag is set in the cache. If it is either a hit or a miss and the 
    security level does not meet the requirements, the access fails.

    The two virtual processors may share the same physical processor in 
    time-multiplexed way through context switching. Context switches between 
    these virtual processors are entered by a special instruction that invokes 
    the monitor mode.  Typically, the monitor mode will save the general 
    purpose registers and any processor configuration registers. The TLB and 
    caches are not flushed since the tags protect illegal data accesses.

    To play the DRM protected video, the secure world must first authenticate 
    the user's subscription. The normal world loads authentication data (such 
    as a username and password) into the cache and requests that the secure 
    world authenticate the user through a special instruction. This invokes the 
    monitor mode which context switches out the normal world virtual processor 
    and replaces it with the secure world virtual processor. The secure world 
    processor communicates with a remote server to authenticate the user.  
    Unless authentication has succeeded, any subsequent requests to play a 
    video will fail.
    % Adding an explanation of authentication seems to add complicated details 
    % like communication with a remote server, and it takes up a lot of writing 
    % space. Maybe we can skip this part and just cover the video playback part 
    % since this is only here as an example anyway.

    The video itself is sent to the device through an encrypted stream. The key 
    used for decryption is stored inside the secure world virtual processor .  
    To play the video, the user space application loads the encrypted data into 
    the cache, tagging it as normal world readable. It then issues a special 
    instruction to interact with the secure world which decrypts the stream, 
    which context switches to the secure world virtual processor as before. The 
    secure world virtual processor
    reads the encrypted data in the cache, decrypts it with a key that is only 
    readable by the secure world, tags it as readable by the normal world, and 
    invokes the monitor to return execution to the normal world. Note that the 
    data is not cleared from the TLB or cache during context switches.  The 
    normal world and secure world virtual processors can execute in separate 
    cores which communicate through the shared cache instead of context 
    switching, however, since they operate on the same data, it is generally 
    better if they share the same core allowing them to both access the data 
    quickly in the private cache. 

    This TrustZone inspired baseline protects the confidentiality of the secret 
    key and minimizes the trusted code base to a small software library.  
    However, it does not defend against timing channel attacks.
    For example, the adversary could measure the time spent in the secure world 
    while decrypting the video with a key. This depends on cache timing which 
    can be correlated with the key \cite{bernstein,others}.
    Since the adversary is capable of any software attack and 
    microarchitectural timing channels can be exploited in software, these 
    channels must be eliminated to meet all the security requirements of the 
    system.
