    Figure \ref{fig:baseline} shows the baseline architecture which is later extended to 
    include timing channel protection. The architecture has multiple cores, 
    each with a branch predictor, one or more private caches, a TLB, and the 
    core logic. Each processor is connected to a shared cache through an 
    on-chip network. The multicore processor is connected to the main memory 
    and a DMA module through the system bus.
