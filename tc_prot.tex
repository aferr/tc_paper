\section{Timing Channels}
The baseline architecture is vulnerable to microarchitectural timing channels 
caused by shared resources including the private and shared caches, the on chip 
network, the system bus, and the main memory.

\subsection{Private Caches}
The baseline private caches are shared among security domains whenever a core 
context switches between them. Since the cache timing behavior observable by 
one security domain depends in the private cache depends on the data the other 
security domain operates on, this causes a timing channel. For example, the 
normal world VM can load various sets of addresses into the cache and make the 
same request from the secure world VM while monitoring the time required to 
fulfill the request each time. In this way, the adversarial normal world 
program can learn if fulfilling the request depended on these addresses. Since 
memory addresses operated on by the secure world may depend on sensitive data 
(e.g. through branch conditions), sensitive data may be leaked. In addition, it 
is possible for the secure world VM to evict cache lines which were brought 
into the cache by the normal world. Which cache lines are evicted depends on 
the data operated on by the secure world, so clearly the cache replacement 
policy also causes a timing channel
