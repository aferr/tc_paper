\section{Timing Channels}
The baseline architecture is vulnerable to microarchitectural timing channels 
caused by shared resources including the private and shared caches, the on chip 
network, the system bus, and the main memory. Furthermore, data-dependent 
variations in the timing parameters of microarchitectural components can cause 
timing channels even in the absence of sharing.

\subsection{Private Caches}
The baseline private caches are shared among security domains whenever a core 
context switches between them. Despite the lack of concurrent sharing, private 
caches cause information leakage between context switches and through variation 
in timing not due to sharing. 

The fundamental cause of all cache timing channels is that cache space is 
finite and requests for data that is present in the cache finish more quickly 
than requests for data that is not in the cache. Caches typically contain data 
that is likely to be accessed in the future. The data that is used by a program 
depends on actual data values which are potentially secret (for example through 
control flow). 

The primary sources of timing channels are data sharing from lower class 
security domains to higher class security domains, cache line eviction, and 
total execution time variation. The examples presented in this section are 
based on the DRM usage scenario and threat model, but the timing channel 
sources are generalizable to many cases.

The cache timing behavior observable by one security domain depends on the data 
the other security domain operates on. This causes a timing channel. For 
example, the normal world VM can load various sets of addresses into the cache 
and make the same request from the secure world VM while monitoring the time 
required to fulfill the request each time.  Since normal world entries may be 
used by the secure world, the time spent in secure world depends on whether or 
not the data loaded by the normal world is used by the secure world.
Since memory addresses operated on by the secure world may depend on sensitive 
data (e.g. through branch conditions), sensitive data may be leaked. 

In addition, it is possible for the secure world VM to evict cache lines which 
were brought into the cache by the normal world.  Which cache lines are evicted 
depends on the data operated on by the secure world, so the cache replacement 
policy also causes a timing channel

Even if interference were eliminated, the total time required to complete a 
request in secure world depends on the cache state and therefore the data 
operated on by the secure world. Since the adversary can observe the time spent 
in secure world, attacks which aim to correlate execution time to the secret 
(such as the attack proposed by Bernstein \cite{bernstein}) are possible.

\subsection{TLBs and Branch Predictors}
As with private caches, TLBs and branch predictors are shared among security 
domains between context switches and have state that causes the total execution 
time of tasks to correlate with private data. As a result, similar approaches 
can be taken to prevent timing channels in all three of these per-core 
resources, however, different approaches may be desirable because each resource 
affects performance differently.

\subsection{Shared Caches}
Unlike the private caches, shared caches allow concurrently executing security 
domains to interfere with one another. However, the sources of timing channels 
are still similar to those in the private cache. As with private caches, it is 
possible for an adversary to exploit the ability of a higher level security 
domain to access entries owned by a lower level domain to determine which 
addresses are used. However the lower level domain can cause interference while 
the secure domain is executing, not just between context switches. This allows 
the attacker to have finer-grained control over when interference takes place, 
potentially allowing for faster exfiltration of secrets. Similarly, if a domain 
evicts cache entries owned by another concurrently executing domain with which 
the former domain shares the cache, the latter domain can observe this and 
potentially extract secret information. As with private caches, the timing of a 
single security domain depends on it's shared cache access pattern, and 
therefore, overall timing is correlated with data values even without 
interference.

\subsection{Main Memory}
The main memory is shared between concurrently executing security domains, and 
analagous to the timing disparity between cache hits and misses page faults in 
main memory take substantially longer than accessing entries that are present 
in main memory.
