\section{Related Works}
Numerous internal microarchitectural timing channels have been exposed in
caches~\cite{percival,bernstein,caseofaes,remoteaes,analyticalcache,collision,
deconstructing,cachegames}, branch predictors 
\cite{branchpred,predictingbranch}, processor
pipelines \cite{pipelines}, networks on chip~\cite{yaonocs,surfnoc}, and memory
controllers~\cite{ushpca14,fletcher-hpca14}. However, the internal timing 
channels caused by the response ports of caches and memory controllers and by 
contention for MSHRs in caches are new.  Solutions for timing channels caused 
by individual components such as caches~\cite{newcache,deconstructing}, memory
controllers~\cite{ushpca14,fletcher-hpca14}, and nentworks on chip 
~\cite{yaonocs,surfnoc} have
been proposed.

However, this paper presents the first microarchitecture to address all 
internal microarchitectural timing channels. Ascend~\cite{ascend} proposes a
microarchitecture that eliminates external timing channels, but does not
address internal timing channels. Execution leases~\cite{execution_leases} 
provide another external timing channel solution at the hardware level by 
enforcing strict upper bounds on the execution times of program subsections. 

Timing channels are a form of information flow, and many approaches to 
controlling timing channels are based in information flow theory. Language 
level approaches track information flow and to either 
eliminate~\cite{quantleaks} or 
reduce~\cite{mitigation1,mitigation2,mitigation3} timing channels. At the 
systems level, information flow has been used to provide security 
through explicit channels ~\cite{flume-sosp07,histar-sosp06,laminar-pldi09}. 
These can be combined with timing compartments to provide total software 
isolation.

Work has also been done to verify hardware timing channel protection. GLIFT 
\cite{glift-asplos09} tracks all information flows, (including timing channels) 
in hardware at the gate level, though it does so at a high cost. GLIFT has 
later been used to develop information flow property checkers in gate level 
simulators ~\cite{glift-dac10,glift-dac11,glift-isca11}, and more recently 
hardware description languages that verify timing channel securtity 
~\cite{caisson-plas10,caisson-pldi11,sapper-plas13}.
